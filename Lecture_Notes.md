# Data Visualisation, an Introduction 

## Graphics 

Graphics is a powerful communication tool to synthesis information, Explore Dataset, Visual testes and Commonication of results 

To have a good graphics it needs to be :
+ readable : Take place of the reader.  
+ intelligable : Try to understand what is the message  
+ and no possibility of missunderstanding : Only one message pass trought the graphics

A nice picture need to induce some question, reaction (interresting one) -> generate discussion 
A discussion leads to new ideas 

A picture is not a proof, should have inference then compute value to proove the inference was right 


Guidelines for good graphics : 
1. Try to get the minimal intercation to present curve -> Minium effort for the reader
2. Show the most interessting data -> Minimize Ink
3. Do not put all things inside one picture, not readable anymore -> one scale per graphics 
4. Do not put the information inside the picture -> cryptic information so the reader as to go trough the article to understand the picture
5. Carreful to non-relevant graphics objects (scale must be adapted for the infomation to pass)
6. Scale can be use to cheat with data (information pass could be really different depanding on the sacale with the same data) -> be aware of that when modifing scale
7. Use traditinal conventions 


**Conclusion** : 
To help build a nice picture can follow principles of : 
- *Occam's razor* : If two represnetations contain the same inforamtion chose the simpler one
- *Completion(Dijkstra)* : When can not remove any simple object from the representation then it's complete
- *Commun sense* : Use an adapted sophistical level (depend on the target)
